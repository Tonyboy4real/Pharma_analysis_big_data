# Pharma_analysis_big_data

This was an analysis of a big data from a pharmasutical company. There were many interesting patterns.

The purpose of this work is to identify patterns that may be useful for decision-making by management in the marketing industry.
Sales representatives go to various places to advertise the company's products. They themselves record their visits in a special program on a personal tablet, which also shows a presentation. The program captures a lot of data: time, presentation type, latitude, longitude, etc.
During the EDA process of these data, interesting patterns were revealed.

Fig.1 shows a bar chart where you can see the number of trades on a particular date. It was built on the basis of more than three hundred thousand observations.

So we see that on New Year's Eve we have a record for making deals. It is also worth noting that almost no deals were made on Wednesdays and Thursdays.





2. In Fig. 2 - a bar chart that shows the time of day and the number of transactions. It was also built on the basis of the above data and a random sampling method, but this time the emphasis was on the time in the day. As we can see, most transactions are made in the morning until 11:00. Least of all sales representatives make deals in the evening at 17:00. Managers can optimize and increase the profit of the company by speeding up working hours.

Conclusions from the EDA: the most optimal time for promotion of goods by sales representatives is the morning on New Year's Eve.
It is possible to significantly reduce production costs, thereby increasing profits by freeing up TP on Wednesdays and Thursdays and after 16:00.
Thus, based on big data, interesting patterns were derived that can increase profits for marketing companies.
